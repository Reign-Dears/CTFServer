  Communication Channels

  There are three channels of communicating information from the ESP32 to the MQTT Broker. 
  All three channels are taken from the MQTT broker and stored in the database.

  `sendDataToServer()` is used for all three channels. It requires two arguments - `topic` and `message`.

  Each topic has a keyword, followed by the `mqttClient`, defined abovce
  For example: "updateChallenges/Windmill".

  `message` is the data to be sent, as a String.

  Channel Keywords:

  // Update the `moduleValue` field in the database by sending to the broker
  // This can be used to 'reset' the challenge for the next user.
  // For instance, after a set amount of time, you could reset the moduleValue to 0, which would make the challenge unsolved again until a user solves it and updates the moduleValue to 1.
  sendDataToServer("updateChallenges/" + String(mqttClient), String(randomNumber));

  // Upload data for the module, which is attached to the challenge. The data shows on the challenge page on the website.
  // The data can be anything. It could be data used to assist the user with the challenge, or it could be fake data meant to mislead the user. It's up to you to decide how to use it!
  // When the module data is entered into the database, it will be timestamped.
  sendDataToServer("moduleData/" + String(mqttClient), String(randomNumber));

  // Upload event logs for the module. Use this field for Debugging.
  // Log events such as : Module startup, module restarted, resetting the challenge data etc.
  // When the log is entered into the database, it will be timestamped.
  sendDataToServer("eventLog/" + String(mqttClient), String(randomNumber));
